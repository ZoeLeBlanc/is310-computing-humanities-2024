The last two weeks you read about how power shapes and determines the types of data we collect in ways that are not always visible or beneficial for society. This week, we will explore some example datasets to try and understand how power and bias are embedded in the data we collect and use, as well as in determining what we don't collect. We will also explore how we can use data to challenge and critique power structures.

## Group Activity (~30 minutes)

Once again, each group should first create a Google Doc and share it with the class in our Slack channel. Then, the group should split up into two teams, Group A and Group B. Group A should try to find examples for the first prompt, and Group B should try to find examples for the second prompt. Use screenshots and links to show us what you found.

Finally, all team members should try to brainstorm the final prompt together and add your thoughts to the Google Doc. We will then discuss these examples as a class.

- [ ] A dataset that is likely used to enable surveillance or control of a population. You do not need to pass judgment on whether this data is "good" or "bad", but instead think about its functionality and whether those represented in the data have consented to this collection. This could be a dataset that is used by a government, a corporation, or another organization. How are the goals of the organization reflected in the data?
- [ ] A dataset that is used to challenge or critique power structures. This could be a dataset that was created by activists, citizen scientists, etc. How was this data collected and how is it used to challenge power?
- [ ] A dataset that seems innocuous or harmless, but actually encodes bias in some way (maybe that's through the way it was collected, the way it is used, the categories it records or doesn't, etc.). What are the biases in the data and how do they manifest?
- [ ] A dataset that spans a large time period and has been used to make a claim about change over time. What are the challenges in collecting and using this data? How does the data reflect the time period in which it was collected? Are the categories used to collect the data consistent over time?
- [ ] Finally, brainstorm a dataset that does not exist, but should. This could be a dataset that would help us understand a social issue, a dataset that would help us understand the impact of a policy, etc. Why do you think this dataset does not exist? What would it take to create it?
