This week you have read about the history of mass digitization, the early days of Computing in the Humanities, and how some data may never die. To help connect these threads, we will first in groups be exploring some of the digital libraries and archives mentioned in the readings.

## Group Activity (~20 minutes)

Each group should first create a Google Doc and share it with the class in our Slack channel. Then, they each member should try to find an example for the following prompts:

- A digital library or archive that was created before 2000 and is still maintained today.
- A digitized cultural object that either has bad OCR (Optical Character Recognition) or none at all.
- A digital library that uses transcriptions or annotations to digitize cultural objects.
- A digital library that has *born-digital* materials (i.e. materials that were created digitally and never existed in analog form).
- A digital library that has in-copyright or proprietary materials.
- A tool or unique interface for exploring a digital library or archive.

Some of these examples are in our readings from this week, but others will require you to do some searching. Once you have found an example for each prompt, add it to your group's Google Doc. We will then discuss these examples as a class.
