This week we will be exploring how algorithms and data can be used to analyze cultural objects and arguments. Our readings this week considering how humanists are using computers to understand text, the role of algorithms in digital humanities, and the ways that data can be used to tell stories about culture.

But there is a vast amount of research and projects that are using data to explore culture. In this group assignment, you will begin to explore some of these possibilities by finding and discussing examples of cultural data analysis.

## Group Activity

To get a sense of the ways scholars use computational methods and digital tools to analyze cultural data, you will be exploring in groups 

- find scholarly outputs (so books, articles, digital projects, etc.) that use cultural data
- identify the methods and tools used in these projects
- try to locate the code and data used in these projects
- ask ChatGPT to explain the methods and tools used in these projects

In groups, you will create a GitHub repository named `Cultural Data Analysis Group [Number]` and add a README file to the repository. In the README file, 

you should include a link to the dataset and a screenshot of the dataset. You should also answer the following questions in the README file:

### Cultural Data Analysis


- [ ] Find a dataset that contains data about historic cultural objects or practices (historic meaning created prior to the 1980s). This could be a dataset that contains information about a specific cultural object (like medieval manuscripts) or a dataset that contains information about a specific cultural practice (like historic art collecting), etc.

We will be discussing the readings and then working on an in-class exercise exploring projects that focus on text analysis and data visualization of culture.
