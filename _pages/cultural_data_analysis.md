This week we will be exploring how algorithms and data can be used to analyze cultural objects and arguments. Our readings this week have introduced us to the concept of algorithms and how scholars are using these methods to *transform* understandings of cultural data.

In this group assignment, you will once again try to explore the wider array of projects and practices that are engaging in this work in Computing in the Humanities.

## Group Activity

In this activity, you will work in small groups (2-3 people) to explore how computation can be used to not only create cultural data, but also analyze it. While some of you may have some experience with this type of work, I am assuming that most of you are new to this type of research. Part of the difficulty in assessing how computation is being used to study culture is that it requires assessing whether the methods are telling us something new about the topic or object of study. But such an assessment is far beyond the scope of this class. Instead, today we will focus on assessing if computation is being used, and if so, how it is being used.

In this activity the group will decide on two examples to explore, that can be drawn from the resources and examples below or from your own research. The examples have to include some form of computational method and some form of cultural data.

Your goal as a group is to try and answer the following questions to the best of your ability for each example:

1. What cultural data is being analyzed? What is the source of the data and what features are being extracted (if any)? Are you able to find the code and data used in the project?
2. How is the cultural data being transformed? What computational methods or algorithms are being used? Can you identify and explain how they operate?
3. Is computation being used to make an argument or augment the data in this project (even if you're not sure if the argument is sound)? Is computation being used to make predictions or to analyze patterns in the data? Be sure to explain your rationale for your answer.

To help you with this assessment, you can use ChatGPT but you should do thoughtfully and carefully. For example, if you are looking at an article and ask ChatGPT to summarize, each member of the group should help craft the prompt and then each member should try asking ChatGPT to summarize the article. This will help you get a sense of the range of responses and the limitations of the tool.

Each group should create a Google Doc to record their responses and then be prepared to share their findings with the class. Once you have created your Google Doc, please share the link with the class via Slack. Be sure to include the names of all group members in the document.
