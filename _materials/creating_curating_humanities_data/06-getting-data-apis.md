So far in class we have briefly mentioned APIs (for example, the Genius and Spotify API), but haven't yet discussed what they are or how to use them. This week we will start to work through the basics of using APIs to get data from the web.

## What is an API?

API stands for "Application Programming Interface." An API is a set of rules and protocols that allows different software applications to communicate with each other. 

This sounds very intimidating but it builds a lot from what we discussed of how the web works.
