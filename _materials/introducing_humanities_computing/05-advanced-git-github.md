## GitHub Features

### Advanced Git

#### Branches

#### Merging

A branch is a copy of your project that you can make changes to without affecting the main project. You can create as many branches as you want and then merge them back into the main project when you're ready.

While we won't use much branching in this course, it's important to know it exists. For example, in our repository we have been *committing* to the `main` branch. But we could create new branches if we wanted to try something new.




#### Repositories

Repositories are the core of GitHub and git, and are essentially like folders in Google Drive. They are where all the files, code, and data for a project is stored, along with version histories of them. On GitHub, as you've seen now, repositories can be either public or private. Public repositories are visible to anyone, while private repositories are only visible to the owner and collaborators.

You can view the activity on a repository by clicking on the `Insights` tab. This will show you a graph of the activity on the repository, including activity by contributors, under the `Contributors` tab.

For example, this image is of the insights page on GitHub one of the most popular Computing in the Humanities projects, *The Programming Historian*. Highly worth checking out if you're interested in learning about more advanced programming topics and how they relate to the humanities!

### Issues

Issues are a way to track bugs, feature requests, or other tasks related to a project. They are a way to track the development of a project and can be used to coordinate work between collaborators. Issues can be assigned to specific users, labeled, and commented on. They can also be closed when the issue is resolved.

### Discussions

You have all tried out discussions already! Discussions are a way to have threaded conversations about a project. They are similar to issues, but are more open-ended and can be used for general questions or conversations. They are a way to build community around a project.

### Topics

While GitHub's search engine is powerful, one way to make your projects for findable is to add topics, which allows you to tag a repository with keywords.  For example, if you search for `digital-humanities` and then click on the `Topics` tab, you'll see a list of topics that are associated with repositories that have been tagged with `digital-humanities`. You can also see how many repositories have been tagged with each topic.

### Users

You are all also familiar now with users, since you all have accounts on GitHub. While user profiles are somewhat self-explanatory, there's a number of features for users that are worth highlighting.

#### Profile

User profiles are where you can see all of a user's repositories, issues, and discussions. It's also where you can see their followers and who they are following. You can also see their activity on GitHub, including their contributions to repositories, issues, and discussions.

We can explore some of these features through my profile as an example.

#### Followers and Following

You can follow other users on GitHub, which allows you to see their activity on the platform. You can also see who is following you. This is a way to build community and find other users who are working on similar projects.
